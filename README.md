- The handler handle main interface of SiYuan as soon as DOM changes. In which case if you added too many items, the performance would be influenced.  
- This plugin didn't do extra work to prevent JS injection, in which case you should be more careful using it when in browser or hosted in public net.
- If items you are trying to hide is related to SiYuan's commercial part, please consider to donate to @D and @V (not me) because they lives by writing open-source codes.
