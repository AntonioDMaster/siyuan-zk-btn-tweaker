# siyuan_rmv_btn
A SiYuan Plugin that able to remove the buttons in menu that you don't really use.     
It currently support 3 menus with id `commonMenu`, which are two icons on top right corner of each doc, and calling from the right side of each paragraph.   
# Warning
- The handler handle main interface of SiYuan as soon as DOM changes. In which case if you added too many items, the performance would be influenced.     
- This plugin didn't do extra work to prevent JS injection, in which case you should be more careful using it when in browser or hosted in public net.   
- If items you are trying to hide is related to SiYuan's commercial part, please consider to donate to @D and @V (not me) because they lives by writing open-source codes.    
- No garenteen for 3rd party themes.
